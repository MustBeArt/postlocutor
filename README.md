## Prototype Receiver for Opulent Voice

This is a simple receiver for the UDP-transported version of
Opulent Voice frames created by Interlocutor.

See https://github.com/Abraxas3d/interlocutor

Code largely generated by Claude based on Interlocutor.

The frame structure is in the process of morphing from the 20250528
protocol frame structure to the baseline Opulent Voice structure.

Might need this to run:
```sh
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/opus/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
